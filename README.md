## Hi, I’m Peter!

I'm a technical documentation and systems analyst who spends a lot of time understanding how things work under the hood—why systems behave the way they do, how issues happen, and what the data behind them actually means. Over the years, that curiosity naturally expanded into areas like log analysis, system triage, network traffic, and security fundamentals.

This repository is where I work through hands-on labs, small investigations, detection ideas, and scripts that help me strengthen my understanding of system behavior and security concepts. Everything here is something I walked through step-by-step so I could understand the “why” behind what’s happening—not just follow instructions.

I’m Security+ certified and have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, along with a range of security labs and learning paths focused on SIEM analysis, Windows/Linux internals, and Python scripting. I prefer learning by doing, so most of the work here reflects practical exercises rather than passive study.

My goal is to keep developing the analytical habits used in security operations: digging through logs, correlating events, examining network traces, experimenting with detections, and understanding how system signals relate to real behavior. This repo is simply the place where I document that learning journey and keep track of what I’ve worked on.

<b>About Me</b>

I’m CompTIA Security+ certified and completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I’ve also worked through TryHackMe material and several blue-team–focused courses, but I prefer learning by doing rather than just watching or reading. Most of this repository reflects that hands-on approach.

Coming from a writing background, clear thinking and clear communication have always been at the center of my work. That shows up in how I structure my labs, annotate them, and explain the “why” behind each step. The goal isn’t to copy a walkthrough—it’s to demonstrate how I reason through a problem and what I learn along the way.

<b>What I’m Working Toward</b>

I enjoy work that involves analyzing logs, investigating unusual system behavior, exploring SIEM data, and understanding how small signals connect into a bigger picture. I’m especially interested in how attackers move, how defenders detect them, and how different pieces of data can reveal the deeper story behind an event.

<b> What You’ll Find in This Repository</b>

This space isn’t a list of solved challenges—it’s more of a working notebook. I document:

- **Playbooks and analysis guides** - Investigations like phishing, suspicious network traffic, unauthorized access, malware behavior, and account lockouts. These are written as if I’m handing them to a future teammate.
- **Hands-on labs** - Splunk searches, Windows event analysis, Wireshark captures, endpoint triage, Python log parsing, and various small experiments. Everything includes objectives, my process, and what I learned.
- **Incident reports** - Structured write-ups modeled after real SOC workflows, focusing on evidence and interpretation.
- **Detection and hunting notes** - Search logic, Sigma experiments, ATT&CK references, and early attempts at understanding adversary behavior.

No filler. No “completed module” dumps. Just the work itself.

## Technical Experience

Much of my learning comes from building, breaking, and analyzing small environments on my own: Windows and Linux VMs, Sysmon and event logs, Wireshark captures, Splunk instances, Python scripts for parsing or filtering data, and command-line tooling. I like understanding how something behaves both when it works and when it’s being misused. That contrast is where security gets interesting.
