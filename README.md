## Hi, I’m Peter!👋

I’m a Senior Technical Writer shifting my career toward cybersecurity, something I’ve slowly gravitated to after years of breaking down systems, documenting behavior, and asking “why did it do that?” for a living. Writing has always forced me to understand technology on a deeper level; now I’m applying that same curiosity to security analysis, threat detection, and incident response.

My work here is a growing collection of hands-on labs, investigations, and notes. I’m deliberately building skills the way a SOC analyst actually works: digging through logs, looking at network traces, experimenting with detections, writing small tools, and trying to understand the story behind the data.

<b>About Me</b>

I’m CompTIA Security+ certified and completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I’ve also worked through TryHackMe material and several blue-team–focused courses, but I prefer learning through doing, not just watching or reading, and most of this repository reflects that approach.

Coming from a writing background, clear thinking and clear communication have always been at the center of my work. That shows up in how I structure my labs, why I annotate things heavily, and how I try to explain the “why” behind every step. The goal isn’t to copy a walkthrough; it’s to show how I reason through something.

<b>What I’m Working Toward</b>

I’m building toward a blue-team role where I can analyze logs, investigate alerts, work with SIEM data, and help turn confusing behavior into something understandable and actionable. I’m especially interested in how attackers move, how defenders detect them, and how small pieces of data can reveal a much bigger story.

<b> What You’ll Find in This Repository</b>

This space isn’t a list of solved challenges—it’s more of a working notebook. I document:

- **Playbooks and analysis guides** - Investigations like phishing, suspicious network traffic, unauthorized access, malware behavior, and account lockouts. These are written as if I’m handing them to a future teammate.
- **Hands-on labs** - Splunk searches, Windows event analysis, Wireshark captures, endpoint triage, Python log parsing, and various small experiments. Everything includes objectives, my process, and what I learned.
- **Incident reports** - Structured write-ups modeled after real SOC workflows, focusing on evidence and interpretation.
- **Detection and hunting notes** - Search logic, Sigma experiments, ATT&CK references, and early attempts at understanding adversary behavior.

No filler. No “completed module” dumps. Just the work itself.

## Technical Experience

Much of my learning comes from building, breaking, and analyzing small environments on my own: Windows and Linux VMs, Sysmon and event logs, Wireshark captures, Splunk instances, Python scripts for parsing or filtering data, and command-line tooling. I like understanding how something behaves both when it works and when it’s being misused—that contrast is where security gets interesting.

## 🛠️ Exposure & Learning Experience

- Virtual machines (Linux, Windows) in labs  
- Basic scripting practice in Python  
- Familiarity with Wireshark and Nmap  
- Exposure to password cracking and privilege escalation in controlled labs
